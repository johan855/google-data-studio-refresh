**Step by step guide to use this script**

Please note this is a work in progress.
More improvements to come (Although it's most likely that google adds this feature before a fully automated script can be done).

A) Make sure you have a chrome driver, you can find it here.=[http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads]
B) You can find a tool to manually check step by step how each element ID is obtained here.=[https://htmledit.squarefree.com/].

1) Only for first time connections, enable double factor authentication through your smartphone (You will be prompted to confirm the connection on your smartphone).
2) enable your account to run less secure applications, see this post.=[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en]
3) Run the script changing credentials to your own.
    3.1) Authenticate your connection through your smartphone.
    3.2) If a connection authentication was necessary, you will need to wait 15 minutes for the script to continue running.
    3.3) Once the authentication is done once (per device, so if you launch this script from another computer, you will be required to authenticate once more).
